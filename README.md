# SMS-Game

This is a guessing word game. There are four teams (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) in the event. Every team has his own word in the database that he should guess. The team knows every letter from a treasure hunt game that is happening during the event. And when they collect all the letters, they type the gussed word and check if the word is right or wrong.
